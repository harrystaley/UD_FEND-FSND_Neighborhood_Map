## Project Overview

The "Neighborhood Map" project is a culmination of the skills learned in the Front End and Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegrees offered by Udacity. This repository hosts a responsive, user-friendly web application designed to work seamlessly across modern devices. The application allows users to explore a neighborhood map, which includes features such as searching, filtering, and obtaining detailed information about various points of interest.

### Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document.
- `css/`: Directory containing CSS files for styling the application.
- `js/`: Directory containing JavaScript files to provide the application's functionality.
- `img/`: Directory containing images used within the application.
- `data/`: Directory containing data files, such as JSON files with information about the points of interest.
- `lib/`: Directory containing third-party libraries and frameworks used in the project.
